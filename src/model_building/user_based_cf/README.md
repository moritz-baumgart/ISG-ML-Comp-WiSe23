## User based CF

In this folder I tried to implement user based CF myself using `NearestNeighbors` from sklearn.

I trained and evaluated kNN as a baseline (`00_build_baseline.py` and `01_baseline_predict.py`).

Afterwards I tried to create my own implementation, which only worked partially and didn't really produce good results (`02_user_based_cf.py` and `03_predict.py`)
