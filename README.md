# ISG-ML-Comp-WiSe23

This repo is an archive of my code used during a machine learning competition which was part of a seminar at the [University of Siegen](https://www.uni-siegen.de/).


## Project Structure

The seminar was divided into 4 Milestones: Data Exploration, Model Building, Data Engineering, Exploitation.

- The first milestone (_Data Exploration_) was completely done with plain python files in this repo. It can be found in `src/data_exploration/`

- The second milestone (_Model Building_) I started out with some simple models in `src/model_building/`, but I then switched to interactive [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/), those can be found in `notebooks/`

- The third and fourth milestone (_Data Engineering_ and _Exploitation_) are done inside notebooks as well, but the most part of these milestones was done in [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://learn.microsoft.com/de-de/windows/wsl/), for which I have a separate repo that you can find [HERE](https://github.com/moritz-baumgart/ISG-ML-Comp-WiSe23-WSL).

**Look out for separate READMEs in each folder. You can find more details on the contents of the folder and the results obtained inside these READMEs.**


## Library

To make some data loading and preprocessing tasks that I frequently use a bit easier, I created a small library, which is needed for the newer notebooks to run. You can find more information on that in [its own repo](https://github.com/moritz-baumgart/ISG-ML-Comp-WiSe23-Lib).
