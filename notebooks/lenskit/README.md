### LensKit

In this directory I did my first steps and experiments with lenskit.

I trained a few different models, the code for that with results can be found in `gen_model.ipynb`.

The models were saved as binary files and I loaded them inside `gen_predict.ipynb` to generate predictions for kaggle.

I also did some experiments with using a moving time window on the training data. You can see the code and the results for that in `time_window.ipynb` and `time_window_pred_gen.ipynb`.
