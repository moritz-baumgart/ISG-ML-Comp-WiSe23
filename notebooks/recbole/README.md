### RecBole

This folder contains my first experiments with recbole. I just trained a simple model using `bpr-general.yml` and `run.py`. Because recbole needs a special file format I generated that using `data_prep.ipynb` beforehand. I used the obtained model to a prediction for kaggle using `gen_pred.ipynb`.

Because I don't have CUDA available on my machine I later switched to Google Colab to continue with recbole.
